# PowerShell basics
## Overview
It is a cmd interface. Scripting language. More like a administrative tool, not so much for developers. 

The main unit is a commandlet - a command that just performs one operation. 

Workflows provides an easy way to resume an activity, after it gets interrupted. It also provide a method of parallelization, to do tasks concurrently. 

Can execute external commands.

## Powershell Versions and Editions
Most systems have both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of PowerShell installed. You want to use the 64-bit version exclusively, because most of the PS functionality comes from extensions, and 64-bit extensions cannot load in 32-bit PS env. 

When you launch PS, it will not automatically run a admin. If you need to run as admin, you need to click "Run as Administrator" from the start menu, or, right click the app, then run as admin. Then, you can see in the top bar, showing "Select Administrator: Windows PowerShell". 

The dollar symbol indicates that this is a variable. 
```powershell
$PSVersionTable   # automatic variable, shows version of PS running
```

The core version of the PS, will install on Linux, MacOS, etc. It will continue to be developed and maintained for years to come.
