# 6. Variables, Arrays and Hash Tables
This is on PowerShell Scripting. Instead of one-liners, we will start to write scripts. 

## Understanding Variable Fundamentals
Variable is a named memory location. Instead of using a hex code to refer to that location, we can use a friendly name. It is a storage location where we can put a piece of text, an entire file, a collection of files, a database, etc. There are a lot of pre-defined variables that are already a part of PowerShell, but we can also create our own. The variable itself is a container of memory space. 

Be consistent in your naming and casing of your variables. Avoid space in variable name.
